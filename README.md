Overview

You’re on a mission to help our HR department build an MVP employee salary management
web service to facilitate management and analyse employees' salaries.

The web service maintains an employee list with the following information:

● id - unique alphanumeric ID assigned by the company.
● login - unique alphanumeric login assigned by the company.
● name - possibly non-unique name. May not be in English, so please use UTF-8
encoding.
● salary - decimal.
● startDate - date of start of employment.

As this is a backend challenge, the solution would not include any frontend element even
though you will be building a backend service to support a frontend.
